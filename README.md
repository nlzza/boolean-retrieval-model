# Boolean Retrieval Model

This project was made in sixth semester for the course, "Information Retrieval". We were given a dataset of 30 files. The goal of this project was to form a boolean retrieval model which was made by implementing an inverted positional index. Stemming was done and stop words were excluded to reduce the size of the dictionary. The model handled both simple as well as complex boolean queries.
